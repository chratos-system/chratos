### What is Chratos?

---

Chratos's goal is to become _"a global currency with instantaneous transactions and zero fees over a secure, decentralized network."_

We've applied the philosophy of _"do one thing and do it well"_, we are focused on building the best medium for value exchange in the world.

---

### Key Features

* Chratos utilizes a novel [block-lattice](https://github.com/nanocurrency/raiblocks/wiki/Block-lattice) architecture, unlike conventional blockchains used in many other cryptocurrencies.
* The network requires minimal resources, no high-power mining hardware, and can process high transaction throughput.
* Offers instantaneous transactions with zero fees and unlimited scalability, making Chratos an ideal solution for peer-to-peer transactions.
* As of May 2018, the Chratos network has processed over ten million transactions with an unpruned ledger size of only 3.8GB.
